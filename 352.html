                    <p>2013 saw huge shifts at 352. For one, we ceased to be 352 Media Group and are simply known as 352. To go along with our new label, we created a whole new brand, and as with any new brand you need a new website to reflect that brand. The web has changed a lot since the last redesign in 2009, and while the old site served us well it was time for a fresh start. Over the course of about a month, a small team took a new brand and developed a responsive web solution that will serve 352 for years to come.</p>

                <div class="project-text">
                    <p>One of the new 352 company values established at the same time as this redesign states that "Teamwork amplifies our talents and elevates our abilities". This principle is reflected in the agile process used to develop this site and many others. An agile team is capable of simultaneous design and development, leading to better and faster results. We developed the site from scratch in a little over a month. Many times we didn't have dedicated hours to devote, so there were times where it was hard to work as a team, but the overall process remained a positive one that yielded great results.</p>

                <h2>The Code</h2>
                <div class="project-text">
                    <p>Early team discussions gave me a clear picture of where the client and team wanted to take the redesign. We wanted solutions to handle large photography and text, clean lines and a minimal layout, and simple interactions that put the content first. I started the coding with a base layer, like I do in all my sites. For the past year and a half or so, 352 has used Bootstrap as a starting point for our projects on the front-end. We are still mostly a .Net shop at the time of this writing, and the new 352 site is built on a .Net back-end. I then take Bootstrap and strip out all the parts I don’t want or need. This usually cuts the final CSS by 75% and gives me a clean base to build off. I utilized TypeKit for the fonts, LESS for our preprocessor, and the site runs a custom icon font for the various small icons present in the site.</p>
                    <p>From this base I built out a custom grid system specific to the needs of the site. The use of large photography in the design led me to using more percentage widths than I had used on any previous site. You will note in the coding a few set patterns, but many of the case study pages and the homepage utilize custom sizing on each section of text or photos. The result is a flexible layout that lets me overlay photos on top of the text as you size down the browser and also scale the photos accordingly to fit the screen size. More of the original layout is retained as you size down the browser, and only at a small mobile layout do certain graphics and photos start to be removed in order to save space and retain a smooth flow of information.</p>
                    <p>The responsive techniques in use for areas such as the menu are fairly standard implementations. No content is lost as you move between screen sizes, and an effort was made to keep the original feel of the site without simplifying the layout down to just blocks of text. Since we were moving fast in our development, Adam was only able to develop his designs at a desktop size. I was then tasked with coding the page for all screen sizes, so I had more control over how the layout shifted at various sizes. This amount of control ended up working well for us, and other projects I have worked on had similar flexibility. As long as there is ample communication between designer and developer, the type of work split described can be successful.</p>
                    <p>Another designer, Lincoln Anderson, added many of the CSS animations you see on the homepage and a number of the case studies. We also had assistance from Brent Walbolt who handled coding of the YouCaring case study. Each case study has as much time and effort put into it as the homepage does. While there is a long list of clients on the site, the team wanted a strong focus on a set few clients to showcase. That is the origin of the case study pages, which are some of the highlights of the site.</p>

                <h2>Final Words</h2>
                <div class="project-text">
                    <p>It was a true honor to be the lead developer on the new 352media.com. An opportunity like that only comes around once in a long while, and I am very happy being able to leave my mark on such a strong brand. We had a great team of some of the best that 352 has to offer. The final product is never 100% perfect or what you want, but this site gets closer than any project I’ve worked on in recent memory. The site is proof that a small team, working together to achieve a common goal, can produce solid results in a short period of time.</p>
