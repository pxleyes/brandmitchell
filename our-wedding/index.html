                <h1>The Happy Couple</h1>
                <h2>How we got here</h2>
                <p class="filigree">A mutual friend set Brandon and Christy up for their first date during their senior year at high school. Christy attended Winter Park High school and ran cross-country while Brandon was a member of the yearbook and debate team at Trinity Preparatory school. Their first date was at Starbucks and both non-coffee drinking kids ordered peppermint hot cocoas (still one of their favorites) on Tuskawilla Road.</p> 
                <p>Their parents lived a few neighborhoods down Aloma Avenue from each other. Soon, they were cruising around Winter Park listening to Sister Hazel and going on date nights as often as possible. On December 3, 2002 the couple decided to “go steady”. After prom at each other’s high school, Brandon, who is from a long line of Gator graduates, found out that he got into the University of Florida while Christy got into the University of Central Florida. After 2 years of seeing each other over summers and at Gator football games, Christy transferred to the University of Florida to finish her degree.</p>
                <p>After living together in college, they moved to Jacksonville to continue Christy’s education. Unfortunately, in 2009, Brandon and Christy moved back to Orlando when Brandon’s dad was diagnosed with brain cancer. That was an extremely difficult year but it brought the couple closer together in the end. Brandon is currently working at 352 Media Company, a web design, company based and Gainesville, while Christy is pursuing her second bachelors in nursing. After 9 years of dating, they will officially be married on October 13, 2012.</p>

                        <h3>Maid of Honor</h3>
                        <p class="filigree">My only “little” sister, Amy, is the Maid-of-Honor. We are only about 20 months a part in age. Amy is the only person that can make me laugh until I’m either snorting or no sound is escaping from my mouth. She shares my odd sense of humor-it must be genetic. When I need fashion advice, Amy is the first person I go to. My engagement party dress, my wedding dress, or even for a Valentine’s Day dress she is my #1 advisor. Amy is someone who I used to chase and fight with and now I actually enjoy hanging out and singing karaoke with her on a random Friday night. I have fond memories of staying up late at night snickering with her when I slept on a pull-out bed in her room when relatives stayed in my room. She’s known me the longest of any of my friends for obvious reasons, so I feel she is just the girl for the job.</p>

                        <h3>Bridesmaid</h3>
                        <p class="filigree">I met Angie during my first semester at the University of Florida in my Statistics 2 class. She and I were both struggling with the class and decided to study together. She ended up being one of the most selfless, caring, and sweetest girls that I know. We have a lot in commom-like me, she is a cat lady, and she was in a serious relationship throughout all of college. After Angie got her psychology degree she decided to switch to a nursing career. Several years later I decided to take the same route. While I was taking prerequisites for nursing school and Angie was in nursing school, I was a bridesmaid in her wedding. Now I’m in nursing school and she is going to return the favor. I’m very lucky to have a friend like her!</p>

                        <h3>Bridesmaid</h3>
                        <p class="filigree">I met Sara through my ex-boyfriend in high school. We're talking circa 2002 here. Both of them were on their separate high schools' quiz bowl teams (although Sara's was called “Brain Bowl”). I immediately hit it off with Sara. She was one of the most confident, intelligent, open-minded, and silliest people I've ever met. Sara has always had a strong love for math and science (my weaker subjects) and she is extremely fantastic at both subjects. We have the type of friendship where no matter where we are in our lives or how long it's been since we've last spoken, we can pick up right where we once left off. And there have been tons of ups and downs in both our lives. It's a huge blessing to have someone who has known you forever as a constant.</p>

                        <p class="filigree">I met Bobby during my freshman year at UF. At the time, he was dating one of my high school friends, Lily, and was living in the same dorm building as her. The three of us quickly became close, with me being their third wheel for most of that freshman year. When Christy decided to transfer up to Santa Fe our sophmore year, we decided to get an apartment together. Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how you look at it, Bobby got a job back in his hometown in Maryland that summer. When he moved back to Maryland, we weren't sure how much we would see of him. Never to be doubted, Bobby has made many trips down to visit us over the years. Like a brother to me, Bobby never fails to bring a smile to my face. He constantly shows me that it is ok to just be yourself and have fun with life. Bobby is also a lifelong Gator, and we love him for it.</p>

I was a shy kid, but I knew the three guys heading up design at the time were going to be great mentors. I don't remember exactly when it happened, but there must have been one client along the way that we got saddled together. We formed this interesting, symbiotic relationship. I guess along the way I became I pretty good coder. Once we both realized that, we started coming to eachother for advice on what we were sure each knew best. It has worked well for us, and you'll constantly hear us talk about how the other saved our ass countless times in the past. I guess that's true, and I'm cool with that. I am a better designer because of Tim, and I'd like to think a better person.</p>

                        <p class="filigree">Bill is the ultimate Gator. He is also my cousin. Bill has been a part of my life since birth. For those wondering, Bill is my dad's sister's (Janie) son. For a while, Bill and I had a hard time crossing paths in life. He moved to Charleston, SC a few years before I went to UF, and he returned to Gainesville a couple years after I graduated. Since then, I've been able to get closer to Bill when I visit Gainesville for work or Gator games. Bill and I have also become travel buddies for Gator games, with recent trips to Knoxville for UF vs. Tenn and the 2009 Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. Many of our stories are Gator releated, and while it may sound expected it is never without excitement. I really look to Bill as one of the main male figures in my life after my dad passed. I'm so very grateful for him. Go Gators!</p>

                <h2>We Can't Forget!</h2>
                <p class="filigree">Christy and I have tried desperately to stick to a budget for our wedding. In the process, we made a decision early on to have a small wedding party (and a small guest list). Since we limited ourselves to three each, we couldn't include some of our closest friends. No matter! We are featuring them here, as a way of saying you aren't left out and we love you equally.</p>

                    <p class="filigree">Farnaz has been my friend since we roomed together at a Beta Club convention in high school. Not only did we go to the University of Florida together but she also was at law school in Jacksonville when I lived there for two years. We spent many late nights at the UNF library working on our homework together-we practically lived there sometimes. Farnaz and I had our share of fun nights out on-the- town or staying in too. No matter what we were doing we always had a really fun time together. Now Mrs. Super Smarty Pants is studying to get her specialty degree at a law school in Washington, D.C. Unfortunately, I could only have three bridesmaids and Farnaz isn’t in town as much lately, but if I could have a fourth bridesmaid it would definitely be her. I just love this girl and can’t wait to see her at the wedding.</p>
